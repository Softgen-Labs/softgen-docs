Softgen empowers you to build full-stack applications, featuring a 1-click Supabase integration for backend services. While Firebase was a previous default and is still usable, it requires manual setup outside the Softgen UI. This enables rapid development of production-ready applications with essential features.

| Deployment | Deploy to production (e.g., via Vercel integration) | 游릭 Mature |

**Details on Third-Party Integrations (游리 In Progress):**
Softgen facilitates fast full-stack public deployment through integrations like Supabase (1-click for backend), GitHub (for code management and version control), and Vercel (for frontend and serverless function deployment). The suitability of this specific stack depends on your project goals.

While direct UI integrations for all services are evolving, you can generally integrate many popular services (e.g., Stripe for payments, Resend for emails, various authentication providers beyond Supabase's default) by guiding the AI to write the necessary code. However, integrations that could be harmful in a sandboxed environment (like web scrapers or certain automated tools) are not permitted.
