## AI Persona System Features

Softgen's advanced AI persona system provides specialized expertise that automatically adapts to your development context:

### 🧠 **Intelligent Mode Selection**
- **Plan Mode:** Strategic planning with Architect + Product Manager personas
- **Creative Mode:** Innovation-focused development with Innovation Expert + Architect personas  
- **Standard Mode:** Reliable implementation with Troubleshooter + Performance Expert personas

### 🎯 **Context-Aware Expertise**
The AI automatically selects appropriate personas based on:
- Your message content and keywords
- Current development mode
- Error context and build status
- Project complexity and requirements

### 👥 **Specialized AI Personas**

## Integration Ecosystem

**Details on Third-Party Integrations (🟡 In Progress):**
Softgen facilitates fast full-stack public deployment through integrations like Supabase (1-click for backend), GitHub (for code management and version control), and Vercel (for frontend and serverless function deployment). The suitability of this specific stack depends on your project goals.

While direct UI integrations for all services are evolving, you can generally integrate many popular services (e.g., Stripe for payments, Resend for emails, various authentication providers beyond Supabase's default) by guiding the AI to write the necessary code. The persona system automatically provides relevant integration expertise based on your specific needs.

However, integrations that could be harmful in a sandboxed environment (like web scrapers or certain automated tools) are not permitted.
