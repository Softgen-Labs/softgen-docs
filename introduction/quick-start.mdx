4. **Describe**: Tell Softgen what you want to build
5. **Review & Iterate**: Check the preview and refine

For the latest interface and features, consider using the **new Softgen frontend, accessible at new.softgen.ai**.

## Key Concepts

- **Natural Language Instructions**: Describe what you want in plain English
- **Iterations**: Refine your app through multiple generations
- **Preview Environment**: Test your app in real-time
- **Version Control**: Revert to previous steps in your project or manage your codebase externally using Softgen's GitHub integration.
