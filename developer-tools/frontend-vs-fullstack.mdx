description: 'Understanding the differences between Frontend and Full Stack development modes in Softgen'
---

Softgen offers two powerful development modes to match your project needs: Frontend and Full Stack. Each mode is optimized for different use cases and comes with its own set of features and capabilities.

## Core Differences

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Single-layer architecture focusing on client-side rendering and static content
- **Full Stack**: Multi-layer architecture with both client and server-side capabilities

### Development Complexity
- **Frontend**: Lower learning curve, faster development cycle
- **Full Stack**: More complex setup, but greater functionality and scalability

### Data Management
- **Frontend**: Static data, content files, limited API integration
- **Full Stack**: Dynamic data, real-time updates, full database operations

### Deployment
- **Frontend**: Simpler deployment, primarily static file hosting
- **Full Stack**: More complex deployment involving both frontend and backend services

## Frontend Mode (Next.js)

Frontend mode is designed for projects that focus primarily on user interface and presentation, powered by Next.js.

### Key Features
- **Next.js Framework**: Modern React framework with built-in optimizations
- **React Components**: Reusable UI building blocks
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for all screen sizes
- **SEO Optimization**: Built-in features for search engine visibility
- **Static Site Generation**: Lightning-fast page loads

### Ideal Use Cases
- Corporate Websites

### Upgrade Path
Frontend projects can be easily upgraded to Full Stack mode later by completing a simple onboarding setup within your project.

## Full Stack Mode (Next.js + Firebase)

Full Stack mode combines Next.js frontend with Firebase backend services for complete web applications.

### Key Features
- **Authentication**: Secure user management with Firebase Auth
