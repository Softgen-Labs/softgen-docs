# Wallet & Billing

Softgen uses a transparent, pay‑as‑you‑go wallet. Add funds, then usage deducts automatically as you build.

## Add Funds
- Choose an amount and confirm the breakdown before you pay
- Use a saved payment method from your billing portal
- Instant confirmation on success or cancellation

## Track Activity
- See deposits and usage in your transaction history
- Filter by deposits vs. payments
- Export or copy details if needed

## Manage Billing
- Update payment methods and view invoices in the billing portal
- Refunds follow your payment method’s standard timelines

## Tips
- Keep a small balance to avoid interruptions
- Check the pre‑payment breakdown before topping up
- Watch the in‑app Context Monitor to keep usage efficient
