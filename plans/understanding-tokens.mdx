Think of tokens as the “units” of work for AI models. Larger prompts, more open files, and longer conversations use more tokens.

## Why Tokens Matter

- Tokens reflect the compute the AI needs to process your request
- More context = more tokens
- Managing context keeps costs lower and quality high

## How Usage Works Now

- **Annual Membership ($33/year)** grants access to our best pricing
- **Pay‑as‑You‑Go**: Add funds to your wallet; usage deducts transparently
- **No monthly bundles or rollover**: Keep your wallet funded to continue building

## Tips for Token Efficiency

1. **Be specific**: Clear, actionable requests use fewer tokens
2. **Manage context**: Close unneeded files and summarize long threads
3. **Use the Context Monitor**: Green is healthy up to ~150k tokens; trim above that
