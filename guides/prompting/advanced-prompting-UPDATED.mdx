## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### 1. Contextual Deep Dive Technique

**What It Means:**
Create a comprehensive context that gives AI a 360-degree view of your project. The persona system will automatically select appropriate expertise based on your context.

**Example Prompt Structure:**
```markdown
Project Context:
- Problem Domain: Enterprise Task Management
- Target Users: Remote teams, project managers
- Core Challenges:
  * Distributed workforce coordination
  * Real-time progress tracking
  * Minimal communication overhead

Technical Constraints:
- Must integrate with existing tools
- GDPR compliance
- Low-latency performance
- Cross-platform compatibility

Design Philosophy:
- Minimalist interface
- Intuitive user experience
- Accessibility-first approach
```

*Note: This context will automatically trigger the Architect and Product Manager personas for strategic guidance.*

### 2. Mode-Optimized Prompting

**Leverage Softgen's three modes for optimal results:**

#### Plan Mode Prompting ðŸ§ 
**Best for:** Strategic planning, architecture decisions, feature roadmapping
**Activated Personas:** Architect + Product Manager

```markdown
Example Plan Mode Prompt:
"Let's design the architecture for a real-time collaboration platform. I need to understand:
- Database schema for handling concurrent edits
- WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events for real-time updates  
- Scalability considerations for 10,000+ concurrent users
- Integration strategy with existing authentication systems"
```

#### Creative Mode Prompting âœ¨
**Best for:** Innovation, new features, modern implementations
**Activated Personas:** Innovation Expert + Architect

```markdown
Example Creative Mode Prompt:
"I want to create an innovative user onboarding experience that:
- Uses modern animation libraries for smooth transitions
- Implements progressive disclosure of features
- Includes interactive tutorials with real data
- Adapts to user behavior patterns"
```

#### Standard Mode Prompting ðŸŽ¯
**Best for:** Debugging, optimization, maintenance
**Activated Personas:** Troubleshooter + Performance Expert

```markdown
Example Standard Mode Prompt:
"I'm experiencing slow database queries in my user dashboard. The page loads take 3-5 seconds. 
Current setup: Next.js with Supabase, displaying user analytics with 6 different chart components.
Need help optimizing query performance and identifying bottlenecks."
```

### 3. Precision Communication Framework

**Advanced Prompt Tactics with Persona Awareness:**

> **Pro Tip:** Detailed frameworks like the example below can be saved as **Custom Prompts**. You can capture and reuse your meticulously crafted prompts or explore Softgen's example prompts via **Agent Settings (gear icon <i class="fas fa-cog"></i>) > Prompts**. This makes it easy to apply sophisticated prompting strategies consistently.

- Use precise, unambiguous language
- Include context keywords that help persona selection
- Provide explicit examples
- Define success criteria
- Specify anti-patterns to avoid
- **Clearly specify what *not* to change, or what to *only* change, if making surgical edits.**

**Precision Prompt Example:**
```markdown
Code Generation Requirements:
- Use TypeScript strict mode (triggers Performance Expert)
- Implement clean architecture principles (triggers Architect)
- Follow SOLID design principles
- Generate comprehensive documentation
- Include unit test scaffolding

Performance Optimization Focus: (triggers Performance Expert)
- Minimize bundle size
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals
- Implement efficient caching strategies

Explicit Constraints:
- No global state management
- Minimize external dependencies
- Ensure type safety
- Maximum function complexity: 15 lines
```

## Pro Tricks for Effective AI Collaboration

### Trick 1: Mastering Plan Mode for Strategic Prompting

Softgen's **Plan Mode** activates the **Architect + Product Manager personas**, providing specialized expertise for strategic planning and high-level project guidance.

#### Enhanced Plan Mode with Persona System:
*   **Automatic Expertise:** The Architect persona provides technical guidance while the Product Manager persona offers strategic direction
*   **Integrated Decision-Making:** Get both technical feasibility and business impact analysis
*   **Comprehensive Planning:** Architecture decisions informed by product strategy

#### Strategic Prompting Examples:

**Architecture Planning:**
```markdown
"I'm building a SaaS platform for small businesses. Help me design:
- Multi-tenant database architecture
- Subscription billing integration strategy  
- User role and permission system
- API design for third-party integrations

Consider both technical scalability and business model flexibility."
```

**Feature Prioritization:**
```markdown
"For our project management tool MVP, help prioritize these features:
- Real-time collaboration, Gantt charts, Time tracking, Custom workflows
- Mobile app, API access, Advanced reporting, Integration marketplace

Factor in development complexity, user impact, and competitive advantage."
```

### Trick 2: Context-Aware Error Resolution

**Enhanced Error Communication with Persona System:**

The Troubleshooter persona automatically activates for error scenarios, providing specialized debugging expertise.

```markdown
Error Resolution Template:
- Error Type: [Authentication/Performance/Build/Runtime]
- Exact Error Message: [Full error text]
- Context: [What you were trying to accomplish]
- Environment: [Development/Production/Staging]
- Recent Changes: [What was modified recently]

Example:
"Getting authentication errors in production. Users can't log in via Google OAuth.
Error: 'Invalid redirect_uri' 
Context: Just deployed new version with updated OAuth settings
Environment: Production (works fine in development)
Recent Changes: Updated environment variables for production domain"
```

**Advanced Troubleshooting for Persistent Errors:**

When the AI seems "stuck" in an error loop, use this comprehensive troubleshooting approach:

```markdown
"Instead of making more changes, please perform the following:
1. **Review and Analyze:** Thoroughly review the current context for the blocking issue
2. **Output Debug Report:** Generate a full debug report including:
   - Complete description of the issue and context
   - All solution paths attempted so far (with attempt counts)
   - Cross-reference attempted solutions against current symptoms
3. **Assess Confidence:** Evaluate until you have 99%+ confidence in the solution
4. **State Confidence:** Output confidence levels (1-100) with all recommendations"
```

### Trick 3: Performance-Optimized Prompting

**Leverage the Performance Expert persona for optimization tasks:**

```markdown
Performance Optimization Prompt:
