Team collaboration in Softgen.ai allows you to invite other members to work on your projects. This guide explains how to manage team members and understand the collaboration model.

## Inviting Team Members

To invite a team member to collaborate on your project:

1. Navigate to your project page
2. Click on the "Team" section
3. Enter the email address of the person you want to invite
4. Send the invitation

The invited member will receive an email with instructions to join your project.

## Token Usage System

When collaborating on a project:

- All token usage by team members is deducted from the project owner's token balance

## Access and Limitations

### For Project Owners
- Full control over project settings and team management
- Can add or remove team members at any time

### For Invited Members
- Can access and work on the projects they're invited to
- Cannot create new projects without their own subscription
- Can use the project owner's tokens for project-related tasks
- Can collaborate with other team members on the shared project

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Token Usage**: Regularly check token consumption to ensure efficient usage
2. **Regular Communication**: Keep team members informed about project updates and changes

## Managing Team Members

### Adding New Members
- Only project owners can add new team members
- Each member needs a valid email address
- Members can be added to multiple projects

### Removing Members
- Project owners can remove team members at any time
- Removed members will lose access to the project
