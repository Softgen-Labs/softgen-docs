<Accordion title="What is Softgen and how does it work?">
Softgen is a revolutionary AI-powered platform that allows you to build full-stack web applications without writing a single line of code. Simply describe your project and provide instructions in plain English, and Softgen's advanced AI will construct your application. It starts with a pre-configured Next.js boilerplate and can be customized to your specific needs. With Softgen, you get a complete development environment, including frontend (React, Shadcn, Tailwind CSS) and backend (Firebase) setups, plus the ability to integrate any additional libraries or services you require.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What makes Softgen different from other AI coding tools or boilerplates?">
Unlike basic boilerplates, Softgen provides a fully customized starting point AND builds your entire application. With Softgen, you're not just getting code snippets; you're getting a complete first version of your project built tailored to your specific requirements. It's like having an entire development team at your disposal, working at AI speed and efficiency, all for the price of a standard boilerplate.

<Accordion title="What kind of projects can I build with Softgen?">
