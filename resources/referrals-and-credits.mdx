Invite friends to Softgen and earn credits toward your usage.

## How It Works
- Share your unique link from the app
- Earn **$3 credits** when your friend becomes an annual member and makes their first top‑up
- Hit **10 successful referrals** and receive a **free annual membership** (10 x $3 + $3 bonus!) credited as a usage rebate

## Track Your Progress
- See your referral link and copy with one click
- Monitor pending vs. completed referrals
- View total and pending credits

## Best Practices
- Share with teams and communities who would benefit from faster product building
- Explain the value: annual membership + pay‑as‑you‑go = lower costs as the community grows

## Questions
- Credits are applied to usage (wallet) and shown in your account
- If a referral doesn’t complete their first top‑up, the credit will remain pending
