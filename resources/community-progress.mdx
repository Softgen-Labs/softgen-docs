# Community Progress

Softgen lowers platform fees for everyone as our membership grows. This page explains what you’ll see in‑app and how it affects your costs.

## Platform Fee Schedule
Your platform fee is based on total active annual members. Current default tiers:

- 0 → 14,999 members: **15.0%**
- 10,000 members: **14.0%**
- 25,000 members: **13.0%**
- 50,000 members: **12.0%**
- 100,000 members: **11.0%**
- 250,000 members: **10.0%**
- 500,000 members: **9.0%**
- 1,000,000 members: **8.5%**
- 2,000,000 members: **8.0%**
- 5,000,000 members: **7.5%**

(These may be adjusted by Softgen over time. The app always shows the current schedule.)

## Co‑op Milestones
We’re tracking major community milestones:

- **3M** members
- **33M** members

Your in‑app progress bar shows how close the community is to each milestone.

## Where to See Progress
- Membership page shows platform fee progress and milestones
- Wallet top‑ups show fees clearly before payment
- Referral dashboard helps the community grow (and lowers fees faster)
